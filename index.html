                    <h3>Maker?</h3>
                    <p>
                        At SDSLabs, we are continously designing and building applications. We want people with a passion for creating software products. You should have a willingness to learn and propogate the same. Our members delve into everything from assembly language, designing web applications to game design.
                        <br>
                        Starting this year, We will be conducting a written test in January 2016 for recruitment. The exam will consist of the sections Logic, Programming/Design, HTML/CSS, and Creative.
                    	Starting We are inviting you to show us a project that you can build in the next 10 days. It can be under programming or design category. If your project is good enough, you will get a direct entry to the interview. This means of recruitment is entirely optional. We will have a recruitment exam in January as usual.
                    	<br><br>
                    </p>
                    	<h3>Rules and Instructions:</h3>
                    <p>
                    	<br>
                    	1. Due to the high degree of variance in the projects, the grading will be subjective. Key points we will look for are, concept, implementation, state of completion and code quality (if applicable). Most projects will receive a feedback as well.<br>
						2. You may also submit some other projects (other than the main project) that you have worked on earlier. This is not a necessity, though.<br>
						3. You have to submit a write up (not more than 200 words) for your project detailing why you think it is a good idea and how you went about making it.<br>
						4. All submissions (both design and programming) should take place only through <a href = "http://goo.gl/forms/sqAFo2QBN1">this</a> form. For code submissions, you will need a Github account to host your project(s) repository. Make sure to add a description in the repository as well.<br>
						5. The last date of submission is 8th January 2016, 00:00 AM (the night of 7th). No extra points will be given for an early submission and deadline will not be extended.<br><BR>
					</p>
						<h3>Project ideas:</h3><br>
						<b>Note: These suggestions are to give you a ballpark idea of what we are expecting. You are, however, free to work on anything of your choice.</b><br>
                    	<br>
                    <p>
                    	1. Design and implement a program library which provides article title, summary and other details like publication date in json format given the url of an article.<br>
						<a href = "http://188.166.187.127:8051/?string=http%3A%2F%2Fpyth"> Here</a> is a sample server that takes a variable url named 'string' in the url and returns its 'Title' in json format.<a href = "https://gist.github.com/yankee101/b9a67ed556300d0f7737">Here</a> is the source code (using bottle) for this API.<br>
						2. Write a jQuery plugin for something useful (e.g. an auto-completion box such as Google's search box). <a href = "https://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/">Quick tutorial for a basic jQuery plugin</a><br>
						3. Write a Chrome extension / Firefox plugin for something useful (e.g. a better bookmark manager).<a href = "http://www.sitepoint.com/create-chrome-extension-10-minutes-flat/"> A quick tutorial for making chrome extensions</a><br>
					</p>
						<h4>Design</h4><br>
					<p>
						1. Select a daily life object (e.g. Deodorant, Pen) and design a webpage/poster to sell it. Plus points for using interactions and animations. Need not be implemented on an actual webpage.<br>
						2. Design search and filtering option for Backdoor.<br>
						3. Design a poster to announce an event (like rocket launch) by SpaceX.
