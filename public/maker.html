                        At SDSLabs, we are continously designing and building applications. We want people with a passion for creating software products. You should have a willingness to learn and propogate the same. Our members delve into everything from assembly language, designing web applications to game design.
                        <br>
                        Starting this year, we will be conducting a written test in January 2016 for recruitment. The exam will consist of the sections Logic, Programming/Design, HTML/CSS, and Creative.
                        <br>
                        Every year, we organize some competitions on Erd≈ës, Backdoor, and Codevillage before the recruitment test. The top scorers in these competitions are given a direct entry to the interview. <b>We are adding another such option this year</b>.
                        <br>
                        We are inviting you to show us a project that you can build in 10 days. It can be under programming or design category. If your project is good enough, you will get a direct entry to the interview. <b>This means of recruitment is entirely optional. We will have a recruitment exam in January as usual</b>.
                        <br><br>

                        <h3>Rules and Instructions:</h3>

                        <br>
                        1. Due to the high degree of variance in the projects, the grading will be subjective. Key points we will look for are, concept, implementation, state of completion and code quality (if applicable). Most projects will receive a feedback as well.<br>
                        2. You may also submit some other projects (other than the main project) that you have worked on earlier. This is not a necessity, though.<br>
                        3. You have to submit a write up (not more than 200 words) for your project detailing why you think it is a good idea and how you went about making it.<br>
                        4. All submissions (both design and programming) should take place only through <a href = "http://goo.gl/forms/sqAFo2QBN1">this</a> form. For code submissions, you will need a Github account to host your project(s) repository. Make sure to add a description in the repository as well.<br>
                        5. The last date of submission is 8th January 2016, 00:00 AM (the night of 7th). No extra points will be given for an early submission and deadline will not be extended.<br><BR>
